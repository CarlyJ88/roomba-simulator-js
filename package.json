The Roomba is given a set of instructions telling it which direction to move in. The room has patches of dirt represented as coordinates and when the Roomba is instructed to move it will clean up the patch of dirt if it comes into contact with it. The program takes an input.txt file and return the output as console.log. I have previously made this program using Ruby. This program is written using JavaScript.",
